Stack: Think it as a stack of books. Last in is the first to go out (LIFO)
Programmatically, stacks are arrays with two principled operations: push and pop.
We can reverse the order of an array using unshift and shift methods.

Queue: Think it as a queue in a grocery store. The first go in, the first goes out (FIFO)
Programmatically, Queues are just arrays with two primary operations: unshift and pop. 
If the direction is reversed, we can replace unshift and pop with push and shift, respectively.
