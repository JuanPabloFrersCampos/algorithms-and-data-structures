Opperators used in the explanation:

Bitwise AND (&): Converts two operands, into a 32-bit binary following the truth table for the AND operation. Numbers with more than 32 bits get their most significant digits discarted. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_AND

-

Left shit operators (<<): 
Bitwise shifting any number x to the left by y bits yields x * 2 ** y. So e.g.: 9 << 3 translates to: 9 * (2 ** 3) = 9 * (8) = 72.

Excess bits shifted off to the left are discarded. Zero bits are shifted in from the right.
